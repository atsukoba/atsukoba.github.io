I was in charge of development of software systems used in the improvisation music performance. In this performance we take several approaches to extend the musical creativity in improvisation by creating "alter egos" of Japanese Drummer/Percussioninst Shun Ishiwaka. My works in this project was developping some Agents that responses to Ishiwaka's play in real time, and Meta-Agents that observe musical state of Ishiwaka's play and orchestrate other Agents based on the situation.
