title: 'ExSampling: a system for the real-time ensemble performance of field-recorded environmental sounds'
description: 'We propose ExSampling: an integrated system of recording application and Deep Learning environment for a real-time music performance of environmental sounds sampled by field recording. Automated sound mapping to Ableton Live tracks by Deep Learning enables field recording to be applied to real-time performance, and create interactions among sound recorders, composers and performers.'

We propose ExSampling: an integrated system of recording application and Deep Learning environment for a real-time music performance of environmental sounds sampled by field recording. Automated sound mapping to Ableton Live tracks by Deep Learning enables field recording to be applied to real-time performance, and create interactions among sound recorders, composers and performers.
