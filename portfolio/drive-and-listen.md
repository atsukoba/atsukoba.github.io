We developed an inference environment for object recognition models using YOLO (v2, v3) (Darknet) and unique OSC sequencer for playing in CPU environment. Then sort (non-maximum suppresion) each unique object recognized to convert into sounds. The player is implemented with MIDI connection between Max and Ableton Live.
