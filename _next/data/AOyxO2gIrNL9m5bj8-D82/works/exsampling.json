Automated sound mapping to Ableton Live tracks by Deep Learning enables field recording to be applied to real-time performance, and create interactions among sound recorders, composers and performers.","slug":"exsampling","date":"2020-05-13T23:20:16.000Z","category":"Research","tags":["NIME","Music Tech"],"keyVisual":"works/exsampling.png"}},"__N_SSG":true}
