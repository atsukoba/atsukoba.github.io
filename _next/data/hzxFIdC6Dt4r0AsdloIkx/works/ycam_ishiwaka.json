{"pageProps":{"content":"\nThis is an improvisation percussion performance designed as a joint project of Japanese Drummer/Percussionist  [Shun Ishiwaka](https://www.shun-ishiwaka.com/) and [YCAM (Yamaguchi Center for Art and Media) InterLab](https://special.ycam.jp/interlab/en.html). I was in charge of the development of software systems used in the performance. In this performance, we take several approaches to extend the musical creativity in improvisation by creating \"alter egos\" of Ishiwaka. My work in this project was developing some Agents that respond to Ishiwaka's play in real time, and Meta-Agents that observe the musical state of Ishiwaka's play and orchestrate other Agents based on the situation.\n\n## Teaser\n\n<iframe title=\"vimeo-player\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/701264303?h=dd404cde3c\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n","data":{"description":"","title":"Echoes for unknown egos â€• manifestations of sound","slug":"echoes-for-unknown-egos","date":"2022-06-04T23:20:16.000Z","category":"Performance","tags":["Music","AI","Works","Performance"],"keyVisual":"/images/works/echoesforunknownegos.jpg"}},"__N_SSG":true}
