In the context of computer music and digital art, interactive experiences that concentrate on the surrounding objects and physical spaces have also been designed. In recent years, with the development and popularization of devices, an increasing number of works have been designed in Extended Reality to create such musical experiences. In this paper, we describe MR4MR, a sound installation work that allows users to experience melodies produced from interactions with their surrounding space in the context of Mixed Reality (MR). Using HoloLens, an MR head-mounted display, users can bump virtual objects that emit sound against real objects in their surroundings. Then, by continuously creating a melody following the sound made by the object and re-generating randomly and gradually changing melody using music generation machine learning models, users can feel their ambient melody \"reincarnating\".\n\n[![Image from Gyazo](https://i.gyazo.com/7866eb5bfa812c8c486078d8a7cba279.gif)](https://gyazo.com/7866eb5bfa812c8c486078d8a7cba279)\n\n## Paper\n\n[[2209.07023] MR4MR: Mixed Reality for Melody Reincarnation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07023)\n\nPlease cite as\n\n_Kobayashi, Atsuya, Ishino, Ryogo, Nobusue, Ryuku, Inoue, Takumi, Okazaki, Keisuke, Sawa, Shoma, & Tokui, Nao.
