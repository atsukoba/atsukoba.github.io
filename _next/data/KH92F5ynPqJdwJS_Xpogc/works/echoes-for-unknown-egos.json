{"pageProps":{"content":"\nThis is an improvisation percussion performance designed as a joint project of Japanese Drummer/Percussionist  [Shun Ishiwaka](https://www.shun-ishiwaka.com/) and [YCAM (Yamaguchi Center for Art and Media) InterLab](https://special.ycam.jp/interlab/en.html). I was in charge of the development of several software systems used in the performance. We have taken several approaches to extend the musical creativity in improvisation by creating \"alter egos\" of Ishiwaka. My work in this project was developing some Agents that respond to Ishiwaka's play in real time, and \"Meta-Agents\" that observe the musical state of Ishiwaka's play and orchestrate other Agents based on the situation.\n\n## Melody Agent\n\n*Melody* agent plays generated melody in real-time along with Ishiwaka's drums play.\n\n[![Image from Gyazo](https://i.gyazo.com/6acbb5bf0b6b2f5b16a4a4c2ffca7388.jpg)](https://gyazo.com/6acbb5bf0b6b2f5b16a4a4c2ffca7388)\n\n## Sampler Agent\n\n**Sampler** agent plays recorded samples of Ishiwaka's past Piano play along with drums play.\n\n[![Image from Gyazo](https://i.gyazo.com/4c059f470d1506f1144ec5e0463c8e8b.gif)](https://gyazo.com/4c059f470d1506f1144ec5e0463c8e8b)\n\n## Meta Agent\n\n**Meta-Agent** is an agent that controls other agents play style and designs combination of agents.\n\n[![Image from Gyazo](https://i.gyazo.com/6e06641f939c6d6215cb96ae0938ca38.gif)](https://gyazo.com/6e06641f939c6d6215cb96ae0938ca38)\n\n## Teaser\n\n<div class=\"iframe-video-wrapper\">\n    <iframe class=\"iframe-video\" title=\"vimeo-player\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/701264303?h=dd404cde3c\" \n    frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n## Echoes for unknown egos―manifestations of sound (Day1 / Excerpt)\n\n<div class=\"iframe-video-wrapper\">\n    <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/741153714?h=7700f875f6\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n## Echoes for unknown egos―manifestations of sound (Day2 / Excerpt)\n\n<div class=\"iframe-video-wrapper\">\n    <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/741154438?h=da4028b79f\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n## Links\n\n[Echoes for unknown egos―発現しあう響きたち](https://www.ycam.jp/events/2022/echoes-for-unknown-egos/)  \n[Echoes for unknown egos ― manifestations of sound (en)](https://www.ycam.jp/en/events/2022/echoes-for-unknown-egos/)","data":{"description":"","title":"Echoes for unknown egos ― manifestations of sound","slug":"echoes-for-unknown-egos","date":"2022-06-04T23:20:16.000Z","category":"Performance","tags":["Music","AI","Works","Performance"],"keyVisual":"/images/works/echoesforunknownegos.jpg"}},"__N_SSG":true}
