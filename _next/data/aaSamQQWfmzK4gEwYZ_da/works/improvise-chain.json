This work aims to highlight the differences for viewers to consider between humans and artificial intelligence in music jams by visualizing the only information virtual musicians can communicate with while humans interact in various modals during the performance.\n\n[![Image from Gyazo](https://i.gyazo.com/ec20beb9c1bee4a9040eff3917421949.png)](https://gyazo.com/ec20beb9c1bee4a9040eff3917421949)\n\nWe developed user interface for installers using Max/MSP patcher that can be used as a monitor of value for LED control and attentions.\n\n---\n\nResearch & Development: Atsuya Kobayashi  \nConcept Design: Atsuya Kobayashi  \nVisualization : Ryo Simon  \nFilming : Asuka Ishii, Kazufumi Shibuya\n","data":{"description":"Improvise+=Chain [2022] is an audio-visual installation work of listening to AI's improvisation ensemble.","title":"Improvise+=Chain","slug":"improvise-chain","date":"2022-11-15T12:00:00.000Z","category":"Installation","tags":["Music","AI","Works","Performance"],"keyVisual":"/images/works/improvise-chain.jpg"}},"__N_SSG":true}
